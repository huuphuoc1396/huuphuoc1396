### üöÄ Projects
- [**Android Template**](https://github.com/huuphuoc1396/android-template): This project is designed to streamline the development of Android applications using Clean Architecture principles. It provides a robust foundation for building scalable, maintainable, and testable applications by separating concerns into distinct layers.
- [**Android Step Detector**](https://github.com/huuphuoc1396/android-step-detector): This project leverages either the `TYPE_STEP_DETECTOR` or `TYPE_ACCELEROMETER` sensors to detect steps. It avoids `TYPE_STEP_COUNTER` due to inconsistent triggering on some devices. The sample ensures broad compatibility by offering a fallback to accelerometer-based step detection using Sensor Fusion Math, making it a versatile solution for step detection across various devices.
- [**Android Multiple Screens**](https://github.com/huuphuoc1396/android-multiple-screens): This sample project demonstrates how to display two activities on two screens simultaneously. It also includes integration for LG dual screens using the LG SDK. With the rise of foldable phones, handling multi-display configurations is increasingly important, and this project ensures that activities work seamlessly on secondary displays, even supporting multi-resume functionality.
